      h3 Asking Questions
      p The Watson API is incredibly powerful, but this sample is designed using only the 
        a(href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/qaapi/") public healthcare
        |  data set, which is trained to only answer 
        a(href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/qaapi/#corpora") specific kinds of questions. 
      p Watson QA data corpora can be customized and created for any data set, however this requires system training and an engagement with IBM.  Only limited healthcare and travel copora are available for the free public data sets.
